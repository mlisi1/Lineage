/**
 * The atmosphere over the scene (R4, ADR 0021): the light, what glows in the dark, the

 *
 *   light     the colour multiplied over everything (`light.ts`): moonlit blue at night,
 *             rose at dusk, lilac at dawn, day graded by the season, greyed by rain;
 *             eased between the sim's 10-minute steps
 *   glow      light added over the tint, so that it shows in the dark: the spots of
 *             animals with the glow gene, fires, lava, sparks, beams
 *   weather   rain while the rain god power's rain falls; smoke over burning cells; ash
 *             and lava from a volcano; a shake and dust for an earthquake; a meteor's
 *             streak, flash and dust where it digs its crater; light from the sky where
 *             the seed and ark powers fall; a flash when lightning starts a fire
 *   the end   the apocalypse sequence (`apocalypse.ts`), about three minutes on the map
 *
 * Its layers go in the scene in this order: the world (land, plants, animals) and then
 * `ground` (cells: the risen sea, smoke, dust), `weather` (art pixels of the screen: rain,
 * falling ash), `tint` (the light, multiplied over all of those), `lights` (cells, added
 * over the tint) and `flash` (the screen, over everything). The scroll and the dip
 * between views are page elements and take none of it.
 *
 * Short things (a shake, a meteor, a beam) last a few wall seconds, so that they read at
 * any speed; a volcano's eruption lasts sim-hours, and at least some wall seconds.
