/**
 * A cap on the frame rate (R5, ADR 0022): the owner holds the kiosk at 30 fps on the board,
 * which has no fan, so that the GPU draws half of what a 60 Hz screen would ask of it.
 *
 * Chromium has no switch for this: its flags either take the limit off
 * (`--disable-gpu-vsync`, `--disable-frame-rate-limit`) or keep the display's refresh, and
 * none caps a page below it. So the page caps itself: the ticker's own animation-frame
 * loop is stopped and one of ours drives it, letting a frame through only when a whole
 * frame of the cap has gone by since the last one drawn. At 60 Hz every other refresh is
 * drawn; nothing is drawn, moved or uploaded on the ones in between.
 *
 * PixiJS has `Ticker.maxFPS`, but it rounds the time since the last frame down to a whole
 * millisecond before comparing it with the frame's 33.33 ms, so at 60 Hz it lets through
 * every third refresh (20 fps) as often as every other.
