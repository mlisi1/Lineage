/**
 * The documentary camera (R3, ADR 0020): which view the screen shows, where it looks,
 * and whom it follows. The owner's view button steps through the three views:
 *
 *   map      the whole continent, still: where the desk rests
 *   middle   a region, drifting slowly from one place on the island to another
 *   local    one animal from close by, of a species drawn at random; after about five
 *            minutes another, glided to if it is near, cut to if not
 *
 * and from the local view back to the map. While a chronicle entry with a place is on the
 * scroll, the local view's camera leaves its animal to visit the place, holds there while
 * the entry is read and comes back to the same animal (R5). Fifteen minutes after the last press the
 * screen goes back to the map by itself. Changes of view, and cuts, dip to dark and back,
 * waiting in the dark until the new view is painted (painted pixels shimmer at zooms in
 * between, so the camera never zooms: renderer.md).
 *
 * Pure: the page hands it the time that passed, what the world holds and whether the view
 * is painted, and draws what it says; random draws come from the stream it is given.
