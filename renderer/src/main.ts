/**
 * The scene (R1–R3): the land, its plants and its animals from the state stream, filmed
 * by the documentary camera (`director.ts`), with the chronicle's notable entries on a
 * scroll (`captions.ts`) and, in the local view, a card naming the animal followed
 * (`card.ts`, R5); drawn at 512×300 art pixels and stretched to the screen
 * without smoothing. The picture is drawn a pixel larger all round and slid by the
 * camera's fraction of a pixel, so that slow pans glide instead of stepping a whole art
 * pixel at a time.
 *
 * The camera starts on the map. The view button (V, space or Enter on a keyboard, a tap
 * on a phone; on the desk the hardware button, S2) steps map → middle → local → map;
 * fifteen minutes after the last press it goes back to the map. A click or tap on the
 * screen is the button too.
 *
 *   /                          the creatures' recording (`public/stream/life.json`, 28
 *                              days from the v9 fixture) played at `speed`
 *   ?recording=autumn|winter   the land recordings of R1 (no creatures): 3 August to
 *                              28 September, or 15 January to 5 February with snow
 *   ?speed=1800                sim-seconds to a wall second (the default for `life`;
 *                              a sim-day in 48 s)
 *   ?every=1000                instead, wall milliseconds between messages (0: all at
 *                              once, the last day; the default for `autumn`/`winter`)
 *   ?view=map|middle|local     pin the camera to a view (no director), and
 *   ?x=120&y=60                where it looks, in cells (the island's middle by default)
 *   ?follow=20&idle=60         seconds on one animal and before the map comes back (tests)
 *   ?seed=7                    the camera's random draws (default: a new one each start)
 *   ?source=ws://host/stream   the server's stream instead of a recording (S1)
 *   ?still                     the sea does not move (pictures that must not change)
 *   ?quiet                     no captions of the stream's entries (pictures of the land;
 *                              those handed to `__receive` are still shown)
 *   ?painter=inline            paint the ground on the page's thread, not in a worker
 *   ?film                      R4's films: the scene stands still until `__frame(seconds)`
 *                              moves it on by that much and draws it (a recording plays on
 *                              the same clock), so that a film has exactly its frame rate
 *   ?file=report/fire.json     R4: any recording under `stream/` (the report's, written
 *                              by `npm run atmosphere`), played as the creatures' one
 *   ?recording=office          R4: two weeks of the owner's office hours (dusks, nights,
 *                              the Long Night) with the rain god power twice
 *   ?recording=end             R4: a day, then the world ends (the herd starved) and the
 *                              next one begins: the apocalypse sequence
 *   ?show=night,fire,meteor    R4: the light and events asked for, made up on the land in
 *                              sight (`atmosphere/demo.ts`; the stream's own sky is then
 *                              not taken): day, dusk, dawn, night, moon, rain, fire,
 *                              volcano, quake, meteor, seed, ark, end. With `?still` the
 *                              atmosphere stands still too, moved on only by `__advance`
 *   ?cap=30                    R5: at most this many frames a second (`framecap.ts`): the
 *                              kiosk's cap on the board, which has no fan
 *   ?season=autumn:0.8         R5: the stream's clock says this season, this far into it
 *                              (0–1, 0.5 if left out): the land, the plants and the
 *                              leaves blown off the trees as in that season
 *   ?bushes=whole              R5: the local view's bushes drawn whole, as before the owner
 *                              chose them in pieces (`plants/pieces.ts`), to compare
 *   ?ground=fresh              R5: paint all the ground anew, nothing taken from what is
 *                              kept between visits (`terrain/groundcache.ts`)
 *   ?bench                     R5: the benchmark (`bench.ts`): the scenarios of
 *                              `benchplan.ts` on the recordings, the results POSTed to
 *                              `?post=` (`tools/kiosk_bench.py`)
 *
 * The desk's build (`npm run build:kiosk`, into `dist-kiosk/`) leaves the demo paths out:
 * with no `?source=` it takes the server's stream from the host that served the page,
 * `ws://<host>/stream` (S1), and `?film`, `?file=`, `?show=` and `?recording=` do
 * nothing, but for `?bench`, whose scenarios play the committed recordings and make up
 * what they lack as `?show=` does: the one way off the server the desk keeps, so that the
 * board can be measured from the build it runs.
 *
 * Over the scene the atmosphere (R4, `atmosphere/`): the light of the moment, what glows,
 * the weather of events, and the end of a world, during which the camera stays on the map
 * and the button does nothing.
